    By using Flow to handle streams of values, you can transform data in complex multi-threaded ways,
    by writing just a small bit of code!

    You probably know that suspending functions can return a single value asynchronously.
    When using suspending functions,
    you donâ€™t have to worry about threading, the Coroutines API does that for you!
    Flow, however, can return multiple values asynchronously, and over time.

    Why this one isnt suspend?
    Because this one returns a flow
